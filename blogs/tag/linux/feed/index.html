				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Concrete security incident data is typically scarce for any operating system, but the challenge of finding useful data is even more acute for Linux environments. Some folks might even believe that there is no such thing as Linux malware, or that Linux is inherently secure / heterogenous / rare compared to Windows systems. Instead of going into a “why” discussion, I’d like to take a look at reports of actual incidents, describe those threats, and use the Windows malware experience to infer “what’s next” for Linux.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1424" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 130px"><a href="http://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Alon-Web150h-9.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1424" alt="Alon Nafta" src="http://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Alon-Web150h-9.jpg" width="120" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alon Nafta</p></div>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">A key point to consider when looking at Linux malware is that it’s mostly targeting servers. When you compare threats to servers against those targeting client systems, the common exploitation vectors are typically different, in addition to heavy reliance on system administrators’ skill and meticulousness.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What were the major Linux malware incidents in recent years?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Here’s the data I collected for the last 3 or so years:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2011 <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/31/linux_kernel_security_breach/">kernel.org hacked</a>, malware used was some variant of Phalanx, one of the better known Linux rootkits</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2012 A Linux rootkit is caught in the wild, nicknamed Snakso (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193935/New_64_bit_Linux_Rootkit_Doing_iFrame_Injections">a blog post</a> describing it)</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2012 An iframe injection module is caught in the wild, <a href="http://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/12/18/malicious-apache-module-used-for-content-injection-linuxchapro-a/">nicknamed Chapro by Symantec</a>, and later linked to the previously known <a href="http://eromang.zataz.com/2012/12/20/isnt-linuxchapro-a-only-darkleech-apache-module/%20">Darkleech</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2012 Volatility released <a href="http://volatility-labs.blogspot.com/2012/10/phalanx-2-revealed-using-volatility-to.html">a nice analysis</a> of a recent variant of Phalanx (dubbed Phalanx 2) caught that year</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2014 Linux backdoors were found in the wild in large numbers. Because of the high volume, this was named <a href="http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/18/operation-windigo-the-vivisection-of-a-large-linux-server-side-credential-stealing-malware-campaign/">Operation Windigo</a></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">2014 Darkleech is still seen in the wild <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/02/darkleech-bitly-com-insightful-statistics.html">in newer variants</a></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Phalanx and Snakso are both kernel rootkits that use loadable kernel modules to execute kernel code, and various hooks to hide processes, files and network connections. All other used malware “userland” modules that patch existing binaries on the system and use various techniques to evade system administrators and external system audits.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How did malware get in?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linux-running systems are primarily servers, meaning that common exploits targeting browsers (via drive-by attacks) or email clients and file readers (via spear phishing emails) are practically irrelevant. Yet all of these were presumably installed with root privileges, so how did they get in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We can reasonably speculate that many servers suffer from bad configuration, exposed interfaces and <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="https://www.cert-bund.de/ebury-faq">shared SSH keys and credentials</a>. Unpatched servers are also further exposed to publicly disclosed privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and obviously everyone is exposed to zero-days. Since in many cases numerous servers are managed by the same IT administrators, <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://cryptome.org/2014/03/nsa-hunt-sysadmins.pdf">sysadmins are obvious targets for attackers (pdf)</a> for acquiring targets nonlinearly.</span></p>
<h2><strong>These are small numbers compared to Windows incidents, why should this change?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Granted, the scale and complexity of these incidents is significantly inferior to what happened in the parallel world of Windows systems. However, we should take into account the following observations -</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">The technology barrier isn’t as high as previously thought, as demonstrated by last year’s disclosure of the (5-year old) NSA Tailored Access Operations (TAO) <a href="http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/nsas-ant-division-catalog-of-exploits-for-nearly-every-major-software-hardware-firmware/">catalog</a>. Moreover, many Windows malware capabilities can be ported to operate on Linux running systems, for example, <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193283/Malicious_Boot_loaders">using GRUB to retain persistence</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">As data is moving from endpoints to outsourced servers and centralized server farms, we can expect (or fear) that the relative value of exploiting servers is rapidly increasing.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linux server security relies almost exclusively on security-aware administration and capable administrators, since deployed third party security products are sparse. This leaves incredible room for human error and security gaps due to lack of technical aptitude or awareness.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Looking at the Crystal Ball: Malware and Linux</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Linux systems and the Linux security landscape have experienced far less malware activity than its Windows counterpart, yet this very same reduced friction has a major impact, resulting in a relatively immature ecosystem.  The Linux server environment lacks of easily deployed security solutions, third party security products (e.g. anti-malware) and requires high administration skills. These factors make it a relatively fertile field for malware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">While data and computation moves from endpoints to servers, the number of Linux servers holding sensitive data is on the rise and provides an attractive opportunity for malicious adversaries. The technology and tools used by nation-state actors will eventually make their way to cybercrime organizations, expanding their efforts and capabilities to target Linux systems.</span></p>
