				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">A recent <a href="http://volatility-labs.blogspot.com/">Volatility Labs</a> post by <a href="http://www.mnin.org/">Michael Ligh</a> entitled <a href="http://volatility-labs.blogspot.com/2014/01/truecrypt-master-key-extraction-and.html">“TrueCrypt Master Key Extraction and Volume Identification”</a> discusses how the memory forensics framework <a href="https://code.google.com/p/volatility/">Volatility</a> can extract <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> disk encryption keys from captured memory. Attackers able to extract these keys would be able to decrypt TrueCrypt-encrypted volumes and recover supposedly secure data at-rest.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1422" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 130px"><a href="https://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Steve-Web150h-7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422" alt="Steve Weis" src="https://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Steve-Web150h-7.jpg" width="120" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steve Weis</p></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is not a TrueCrypt-specific issue, but rather applies to any memory contents including encryption keys, digital certificates, or sensitive data such as credit card numbers. An attacker able to access memory, either via software vulnerabilities or through physical extraction, can recover these memory contents.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">When it comes to physical attacks to extract memory, such as the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">Cold Boot Attack</a>”, one countermeasure is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack#Full_Memory_Encryption">full-memory encryption</a>. By fully encrypting contents of memory, even an attacker able to extract memory through physical attacks would only see encrypted ciphertext.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">PrivateCore <a href="http://privatecore.com/vcage/index.html">vCage</a> is the only commercially available system that fully encrypts memory on commodity x86 systems. <a href="http://privatecore.com/contact-us.1.html">Contact us</a> to understand the issue or explore how vCage can help protect your memory, particularly your data-at-rest encryption keys.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1422" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 130px"><a href="https://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Steve-Web150h-7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422 " alt="Steve Weis" src="https://privatecore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Steve-Web150h-7.jpg" width="120" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Steve Weis</p></div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">We&#8217;ve recently seen a spate of news stories about hardware-based attacks. For instance, two recent attempted bank heists at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24089350">Bank Santander</a> and <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/eight-arrested-for-barclays-cyber-theft/1753530.html">Barclay’s</a> involved criminals stealing millions of dollars via malicious hardware devices. More concerning, recently leaked documents indicate that the NSA may have collaborated with hardware manufacturers to <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/international/21586296-be-safe-internet-needs-reliable-encryption-standards-software-and">subvert cryptographic hardware implementations</a>. Researchers recently proposed new ways to create <a href="http://people.umass.edu/gbecker/BeckerChes13.pdf">hardware backdoors at the sub-gate level</a>, making it hard to detect even to someone inspecting circuit layouts. But are these hardware risks relevant to servers that we use in the cloud?</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Malicious hardware and your server</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Modern servers are comprised of many components: processors (CPUs), memory (RAM), disks, buses, network cards, and human interface devices. Each of these components pass through the hands of manufacturers, vendors, supply chains, integrators, and service personnel before ultimately ending up inside servers processing your sensitive data. That server itself may be housed off-premise or be leased from another organization, such as a cloud service provider. Most organization rely on at least some servers that are outside their physical control.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">The risk with this loss of control is that is that anyone with access to those components, at any moment in time, could compromise a component or substitute a malicious device in its place. There are many well known boot integrity vector attacks where an attacker could subvert firmware in a system, for example the <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/10/evil-maid-goes-after-truecrypt.html">“Evil Maid Attack”</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Network cards are <a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/paper.pdf">particularly risky</a> since they have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access</a> (DMA) to all system memory and can exfiltrate stolen data over the network. Some network devices have been found to have <a href="http://www.alchemistowl.org/arrigo/Papers/Arrigo-Triulzi-CANSEC10-Project-Maux-III.pdf">remotely exploitable vulnerabilities</a> that allow an attacker to take control of the card and subsequently the host system.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Memory is the new disk</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Enterprises are increasingly adopting in-memory architectures to reduce application latency. However, as in-memory architectures become more common, more sensitive data is persisted in memory for long periods of time. While commonly used RAM is generally volatile, it can actually persist its contents after a system loses power. This allows an attacker to literally freeze memory and read its contents in what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/">&#8220;cold boot&#8221; attack</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">More worrisome, RAM is becoming more persistent with technologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVDIMM">non-volatile memory</a> in DDR3 form factors. By design, these memory technologies persist contents of memory when power is lost &#8212; just like a disk. Attackers could simply walk away with a memory DIMM containing not only private data and software, but also critical cryptographic keys used to secure data at-rest encryption.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">Reducing the security perimeter</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: medium;">PrivateCore&#8217;s philosophy to addressing vulnerabilities in hardware and the risk of persistent memory is to minimize the number of components that users must trust in a server. With today&#8217;s technology, it&#8217;s possible to reduce a server&#8217;s security boundary to just one component: the CPU. From just the CPU, it&#8217;s possible to establish a trusted compute base safe from the rest of the components in the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Protecting against hardware threats is not easy. Some organizations closely audit their supply chains to ensure the provenance of firmware and devices in their systems, and operate their servers in tightly controlled physical environments. For cloud environments or remote locations, this may not be an option. In those cases, minimizing the trust perimeter to a single component may be the best option to reduce the threat of hardware vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data in-use.</span></p>
